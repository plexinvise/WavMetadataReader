Create build with 'gradle clean build' then execute 'gradle constantProps' task in order to create
properties file near the jar. It will be empty. The values for input and output folders might be chosen
later on the first app start or added manually.

Example:

wavInputFolder=./wavInputFiles
outputFilePath=users/userName/output/metadataCollector.txt

WARNING!!! In case of manual configuring really important to make sure that folders already exist.
